Stay strong, ignore the fuckery and hold the line! \\n\\n——\\n\\nUsually the hedgies can short a stock at any time they want. Yesterday they had a small, short lived victory and GME dropped more than 10% (how’d that work out for ya Melvin?) which means it has been placed on SSR (Short Sale Restriction) \\n\\nThis means that if the price is already going down, they are not allowed to short it. However, if the price is going up, they are allowed to continue their shenanigans.\\n\\nMy thoughts on this is that lunchtime yesterday was a test.\\n\\nIf they’re sat on the shorts that went from iBorrowDesk yesterday (right now they have more potential ammo), then they may try to drive the price down every time it starts going up. They may still have a lot of ammo left in the bank. \\n\\nNow if every time the price goes up it starts to tank immediately afterwards, that could cause people to panic and think everyone is selling off their stock which would then cause people to sell, driving the price lower and hitting stop losses continuing the drop.\\n\\nIf I was a Melvin, and I was trying to drive the price down, I would short just enough to drop it each time it goes up and then wait to see if that was enough, if not, throw more at it the next time it goes up until I ran out of ammo. I would probably even let it spike to scare people into thinking that the top has been hit.\\n\\nThis could be an especially effective tactic for them if people don’t realise that SSR does not stop them from shorting completely!\\n\\nApe may be retarded, but ape not dumb. Ignore the bullshit that is bound to unfold over the next 24/48 hours. If you have read the DD and been following this for a while, you know just how fucked they are. \\n\\nHold strong brothers and sisters, moon awaits!\\n\\n🦍💎🙌🏻🚀🌕  \\n\\n🍗🔜👖\\n\\nThis is not financial advice, I’m just an ape with crayons who IS NOT FUCKING SELLING!',\n",

The other ape then sold it back for 8.1 (10% off $9) right when trading resumes. Halted again. Even though only 1 banana is traded within 10 mins, the price dropped 19%, but is not representative of the actual stock price, as they prevented others from trading.\\n\\nAs the stock was more than 10% down today, tomorrow, the shorts are not able to short the stock at bid price. This means if the price goes down tomorrow, it's not because of shorts, but someone / institution selling shares they own.

Now that they technically carry a much larger position with said calls, they will profit much greater. If there is a gamma squeeze on Thursday 3/11 and it surpasses $800/share, it would force a margin call on certain hedge funds. \\n\\nWith said margin calls, it would further increase the price now as smaller firms begin covering. With the price continuing to go up, it would create a chain of margin calls on hedge funds as they’re all forced to cover. This would leave many out of their positions and unable or unwilling to do anything on Friday. \\n\\nTL:DR; “friendly” institution forced price drop via share dump to reposition at a much bigger position with calls at the bottom.

They could force a share recall on Sunday, going into effect Monday, and literally murder anyone with a short position.  \\n\\nedit2: if all calls up to $800 are ITM between 3/11-3/12 there’s the ability for the institutions holding said calls to exercise them and further force a price increase.

I didn\\'t realize that when shorts are borrowed, the borrower has 3 days to use them, or they have to be returned. Shorts HAVE been borrowed, in large numbers, over the past few days. That means that hedgies were borrowing shorted shares, iron handing them, borrowing more, and then they released them all at once (or in large chunks because of the halts). That allowed them to tank the price in a very direct and focused manner, say $160 in a matter of 20 minutes (and that includes the halt times). I believe this was an attempt to trigger stop losses and scare day-traders into selling. The immediate rebound and the fact that THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED TO AMC, AT THE SAME TIME, seems to corroborate this theory.\\n\\nThanks to /u/_Exordium, for explaining this rule for borrowing shorts! \\n\\n220@$125.61 average\\n\\nTLDR: Since there has been millions of shares shorted over the past few days, and they have 3 days to use the shorted shares, I think that the dip was caused by hedgies hoarding shorts to release all at once.

       "  'Hello friends and investors, I have been lurking on this sub for a little while now. I have seen an overarching sentiment among most of the members here that GME is a joke stock waiting to crash leaving behind bagholders as it did before in January. There are numerous comments in the daily discussion asking why is GME up, how is it sustaining this continued rise, and flat out calling the DDs behind it are wrong. Here is an example from today: https://imgur.com/a/4DAJpjE.\\n\\nWhat I have not seen is any actual bearish DD. Can someone with more know-how than myself point me to some actual bearish analysis on this and why it is not going to the moon? \\n\\nCaveat - my portfolio is 100% GME right now. I got out of tesla, amd, space, cciv, mvis, crsr, fvrr, pltr and a few others before they collectively dumped and loaded up on GME. I am up 10k in less than 2 weeks - more than I have made in everything else combined in far less time. I have more $$ than before to buy back into my longs at a huge discount. \\n\\nHere is a question for members here - what will it actually take for you to take GME seriously? At what point will you say \\'I wish I had gotten in\\' or FOMO yourselves into it? Have you thought that perhaps you are reluctant to buy into the thesis because it goes against all investing ideologies? To compare, I play fantasy football (soccer). In the past, I have stayed away from players, who in hindsight hit a rich vein of form, because I didn\\'t believe it. Excuses ranged from it\\'s my rival team or their style of play or unsustainable returns based on underlying stats or I was just too stubborn. In the end I reluctantly give in with a bruised ego. Yes, investing and fantasy football are not the same, but, I am comparing my feelings towards a prospect. Yes, this is an anecdotal reference and I am sure you can think of times where your gut was right, but that isn\\'t the conversation here. How about when your gut was wrong? What will it take to admit that? \\n\\nI hope this all makes sense! Again, I am here looking to have a conversation and not to attack anyone. I have huge confirmation bias regarding GME. I recognize that and I am actively looking for arguments against GME instead of yelling into the echo chamber.  Cheers!\\n\\nEdit1 - you can see in my post history that I have asked this question in r/GME but I was not satisfied with the responses. I am not providing financial advice nor am I trying to change anyone\\'s opinion(s).\\n\\nEdit2 - After reading all the comments, I think I am finally understanding the difference. GME, at the current market, is absolutely not a good long term investment. I would not put money in it and come back in an year expecting it to have grown. I understand that the risk of short-term trading may not be for everyone. My financial situation and risk status is completely different from other investors/traders. Thank you for everyone for having a conversation! \\n\\nHowever, that does not explain the negativity towards GME. It\\'s not by everyone here, but I definitely feel the animosity from some patrons of this subreddit towards any mention of GME (see attached image above for example).

       "  \"As a person who has done testing with them through Navistar, they still do not have much skin in the game. Sure, they teamed up with Daimler to electrify their products, and sure, they have their own bus line but there are a few factors here that most people dont know about the trucking industry and might pose a long term issue to Proterra:\\n\\n1. People in the trucking industry are generally slower to change from whatever diesel, ng, and gasoline vehicles they have to electric, just because of emissions leniency in that marketplace compared to regular consumer vehicles. Because of that, the head start is not something that weighs heavy imo and the market will have plenty of opportunities to catch up. California is a big one, but the bigger projects, such as a few school bus projects,, were awarded to competitors over Proterra.  iirc. IC Bus comes to mind.\\n2. Bus's are also not exactly the biggest market to brag about if we are talking specifically about their ZX5/ZDi/S1LF electric bus's in comparison to the whole trucking market. Other competitors will have similar vehicles out  in the next year or so and while Proterra is already out and with sales, these OEMS will come out with vehicles that have similar eMPG's and will probably aim to be cheaper based on expected sales volume and will have the supplier support and brand recognition that Proterra does not have yet. Once these products come out, it might be an issue for Proterra (speculating here, prove me wrong tbh, would like to learn)\\n\\nA perfect Example of what I mean in terms of Brand recognition and missed opportunities: IC Bus currently takes up  50% + of the market in school busses and have contracts with California already awarded for their eCharge Bus. This bus hasnt really even been released yet, but with majority of the market share, we still got the contract. I can imagine stuff like this will occur as time goes on and with market saturation in EV Bus's.\\n\\n3. Who is to say that Daimler will not pull out of their partnership with Proterra? There are other battery powertrain competitors out there now that will be willing to provide drivetrains, cheaper than Proterra would in the future. Not to mention, this is Daimler we are talking about. They, just like VW have more than enough capabilities to take up their own EV architecture in the next few years (They already are) and scale up for the trucking industry.\\n\\n4. For other types of trucks, vocational, heavy duty, long haul.... Hydrogen Power might be the better alternative long  term. The battery drivetrain is great until a load is given. The eMPG's do tend to drop significantly for applications where there might be a payload of atleast 15000 lbs or higher. The industry already recognizes that and is straying away from batteries for that  reason, except for Bus's if anything.\\n\\nTLDR: Proterra imo, would be awesome if they had a head start and became the TSLA of trucks, but they dont and the trucking industry isnt the same as the consumer vehicle market, By the time they are out with any product outside of the Bus's that they have, they will be behind the industry leaders imo. These numbers wont mean anything knowing that Tesla, International/GM, VW, Volvo, and (yes, even) Daimler are already working on EV/ Hydrogen trucks.  \\n\\n\\nAlso, ask questions.

       "  'I work in ad tech and own Roku stock. There are others I’d consider in the pure ad tech space like TTD, but i went with Roku because of their sole focus on streaming. The one thing not mentioned in this DD is the share of CTV ad spend ROKU is seeing right now and how that space will grow. It’s at 6Bn/yr vs linear TV at 30bn/yr. All of that linear spend is going to shift to connected tv. So why Roku? They get a share of the ad slots in every app that gets put on the Roku platform, they then sell those ad slots to advertisers through a proprietary media buying platform from their dataxu acquisition and power those ads with proprietary data from their streaming devices. Vertically integrated media, data, and buying tool? Who does that sound like? Facebook, google, etc etc... So, for me, betting on Roku is betting a pure play vertically integrated connected TV company with device, software, and advertising revenue. The potential in the CTV segment is huge, the demand is already through the roof, and not compatible with existing ad tech. CTV is developing several walled gardens of vertically integrated companies and Roku is the most focused bet you can make on it since warnermedia/xandr is buried in ATT and Hulu is still chained to the networks.'],\n",

Now that they technically carry a much larger position with said calls, they will profit much greater. If there is a gamma squeeze on Thursday 3/11 and it surpasses $800/share, it would force a margin call on certain hedge funds. \\n\\nWith said margin calls, it would further increase the price now as smaller firms begin covering. With the price continuing to go up, it would create a chain of margin calls on hedge funds as they’re all forced to cover. This would leave many out of their positions and unable or unwilling to do anything on Friday. \\n\\nTL:DR; “friendly” institution forced price drop via share dump to reposition at a much bigger position with calls at the bottom. This forces a greater reaction when it comes to squeezing time 💎🙌🏻🚀🚀🚀\\n\\nedit: if this were to happen it would also open massive doors for GameStop. They could force a share recall on Sunday, going into effect Monday, and literally murder anyone with a short position.  \\n\\nedit2: if all calls up to $800 are ITM between 3/11-3/12 there’s the ability for the institutions holding said calls to exercise them and further force a price increase. If one institution owns a massive amount (let’s say 40k+ calls) and exercises them all at the same time, it’s game over.

So, for me, betting on Roku is betting a pure play vertically integrated connected TV company with device, software, and advertising revenue. The potential in the CTV segment is huge, the demand is already through the roof, and not compatible with existing ad tech.

You\\'re still going to fail 9/10 times, but the rewards are well worth it.\") Now I just buy what I believe has a big growth potential in future whenever I can (and especially during a correction).  \\n\\n\\nEdit to add: Lynch knew that his strategy will make him lose on some stocks (for example, he bought all search engines because he did not know which one will win), but that the winner will make up for it (google did). I\\'ve learnt that I prefer stocks that can surprise me more than I do steady value stocks (I have both in my portfolio). But not everyone is the same.

       " \"As a person who has done testing with them through Navistar, they still do not have much skin in the game. Sure, they teamed up with Daimler to electrify their products, and sure, they have their own bus line but there are a few factors here that most people dont know about the trucking industry and might pose a long term issue to Proterra:\\n\\n1. People in the trucking industry are generally slower to change from whatever diesel, ng, and gasoline vehicles they have to electric, just because of emissions leniency in that marketplace compared to regular consumer vehicles. Because of that, the head start is not something that weighs heavy imo and the market will have plenty of opportunities to catch up. California is a big one, but the bigger projects, such as a few school bus projects,, were awarded to competitors over Proterra.  iirc. IC Bus comes to mind.\\n2. Bus's are also not exactly the biggest market to brag about if we are talking specifically about their ZX5/ZDi/S1LF electric bus's in comparison to the whole trucking market. Other competitors will have similar vehicles out  in the next year or so and while Proterra is already out and with sales, these OEMS will come out with vehicles that have similar eMPG's and will probably aim to be cheaper based on expected sales volume and will have the supplier support and brand recognition that Proterra does not have yet. Once these products come out, it might be an issue for Proterra (speculating here, prove me wrong tbh, would like to learn)\\n\\nA perfect Example of what I mean in terms of Brand recognition and missed opportunities: IC Bus currently takes up  50% + of the market in school busses and have contracts with California already awarded for their eCharge Bus. This bus hasnt really even been released yet, but with majority of the market share, we still got the contract. I can imagine stuff like this will occur as time goes on and with market saturation in EV Bus's.\\n\\n3. Who is to say that Daimler will not pull out of their partnership with Proterra? There are other battery powertrain competitors out there now that will be willing to provide drivetrains, cheaper than Proterra would in the future. Not to mention, this is Daimler we are talking about. They, just like VW have more than enough capabilities to take up their own EV architecture in the next few years (They already are) and scale up for the trucking industry.\\n\\n4. For other types of trucks, vocational, heavy duty, long haul.... Hydrogen Power might be the better alternative long  term. The battery drivetrain is great until a load is given. The eMPG's do tend to drop significantly for applications where there might be a payload of atleast 15000 lbs or higher. The industry already recognizes that and is straying away from batteries for that  reason, except for Bus's if anything.\\n\\nTLDR: Proterra imo, would be awesome if they had a head start and became the TSLA of trucks, but they dont and the trucking industry isnt the same as the consumer vehicle market, By the time they are out with any product outside of the Bus's that they have, they will be behind the industry leaders imo. These numbers wont mean anything knowing that Tesla, International/GM, VW, Volvo, and (yes, even) Daimler are already working on EV/ Hydrogen trucks.  \\n\\n\\nAlso, ask questions. I wrote this up in the middle of the night and probably did not explain my points properly.\",\n",
       " \"Looks like today will be the first day since this tech decompression started that MMs and retail are comfortable catching the falling knife. Most of the big names are up and several are up big. \\n\\nSeems the real test will be in the coming days when it seems reasonable to expect a bit of a retreat from today's exuberance. When TSLA (or insert any other highly valued and somewhat speculative tech) dips 2% intraday, will people run for the exits again? If not, things may get cooking again and SPY can break over this stubborn resistance line. We shall see, I have no idea where it'll go. Personally, I'm not loading back up on tech. But I am dipping my toes in the water. AAPL at this discount feels pretty good.\",\n",

It simply doesn’t add up. It looks like she puts zero effort into valuation and only cares about growth. I’m sure one or two of her picks will become enormously successful. The rest will not. \\n\\nThere is no headwind for value stocks. Value stocks by definition are beaten down far more than even a pessimistic fundamental forecast would suggest. That’s why they’re value stocks. Value stocks are not specific to any one type of business or industry. \\n\\nIf AAPL dropped 80% it would become a value stock too. If TSLA dropped 95% it might be a value stock. Does that suddenly mean they’ll be facing huge headwinds?',\n",

       " '**For newer investors who\\'ve been burned in the last few weeks:** The difference between being an early stage investor in Facebook, Google, TSLA and what most people are putting their $ into now is that the aforementioned companies had enormous moats and little competition in a huge growth field.\\n\\nEssentially, they had a stupid easy path to growth and ***profitability***, and a lot of super easy ways to defend their market position in the 10 years going forward. They also had great valuations, even as they ipo\\'ed.\\n\\nNow? People are dumping their $ into commodity plays like weed stocks, solar panel companies, and generic companies with \"tech\" labels slapped onto them to fetch a higher valuation (ex: $LMND, $SOFI). Surely there will be some winners that come out of the recent IPO\\'s, spacs, and hype stocks, but they will still see a lot of volatility, and there will likely only be a select few that \"make it\" in the very long run. \\n\\n**Edit to add this:** Just a suggestion: Where there is hype, there are salespeople trying to sell you a product.  And yes, stocks count as products, and there is a LOT of people who stand to benefit from selling their product to investors (usually the Chamaths of the world). Also, the more buzzwords you see in a stock, the more likely it is that there is an active effort to sell it to people.
